## 📁 Projects

### 🔹 [001 - Hospital Readmission Analysis](./001-readmission-analysis)
Exploratory analysis on a 25,000-row hospital dataset, focusing on diabetic patient readmissions.  
Includes: Python scripts, Jupyter notebook, visualizations, and project packaging.  
**Skills**: Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Git, GitHub

### 🔹 [002 - Flask todo API](https://github.com/shuwangs/portfolio/tree/main/002-flask-todo-api)
A lightweight Flask API for managing and serving machine learning predictions or todo items.  
**Skills**: Flask, FastAPI (TBD), RESTful API, SQLite, Deployment

### 🔹 [003 - Personal Website (Ongoing)](#)

### 🔹 [004 - PDF Maker](https://github.com/shuwangs/portfolio/tree/main/004-pdf-maker)

A simple Python script that generates a lined PDF document for note-taking or journaling, based on a list of topics and desired page counts provided via CSV.\
**Skills**: Python, FPDF, Pandas, File I/O, PDF Generation

### 🔹 [005 - Excel to PDF Invoice Generator](https://github.com/shuwangs/portfolio/tree/main/005-excel-to-pdf-invoice)
This is a Python automation project that reads Excel-based invoices and generates well-formatted PDF versions for each invoice file. It demonstrates file parsing, PDF layout formatting, and automation using Python.\
**Skills**: python, fpdf, glob, os, path

### 🔹 [006 - Emailing Daily News From API](https://github.com/shuwangs/portfolio/tree/main/006-Emailing-dail-news-from-API)
This is a Python automation project that fetches the latest news articles on a chosen topic using the NewsAPI and emails a daily summary to the user. It showcases API integration, email formatting with MIME, and secure credential management using environment variables.\
**Skills**: python, requests, smtplib, dotenv

### 🔹 [007 - Weather Data API](https://github.com/shuwangs/portfolio/tree/main/007-weather-data-api)
A backend-only project that implements a clean and modular Flask API for querying historical weather data. The system reads raw text-based records from multiple files, parses them with pandas, and exposes multiple dynamic endpoints supporting queries by station, date, and year.\
✅ Demonstrates ability to build scalable RESTful APIs, work with file-based data pipelines, and return well-formatted JSON responses.\
**Skills**: Python, Flask, REST API, pandas, data parsing, JSON serialization, backend development


### 🔹 [008 - Weather Forecast for the Next Days](https://github.com/shuwangs/portfolio/tree/main/008-weather-forecast-for-the-next-days)
An end-to-end Streamlit application that fetches weather forecast data from the OpenWeatherMap API and visualizes short-term trends with Plotly. Users can input any city name, and the app returns interactive temperature plots and condition-specific icons (☀️/☁️/🌧️).\
✅ Highlights experience in full-cycle development: frontend with Streamlit, backend API integration, environmental variable management, and data visualization.\
**Skills**: Python, Streamlit, OpenWeatherMap API, requests, Plotly, dotenv, data visualization, interactive UI

### 🔹 [009 - NLP(Natural Language Processing) for eBooks](https://github.com/shuwangs/portfolio/tree/main/009-nlp-for-ebook)
A data science project focused on extracting insights from eBook text using classic NLP techniques. The notebook processes raw book content by cleaning text, removing stopwords, and performing tokenization. It then applies frequency analysis and visualizes key terms using word clouds. Optional sentiment analysis and named entity recognition are considered for deeper understanding.\
✅ Demonstrates the use of NLP preprocessing steps, text analysis, and data visualization to uncover patterns in literary works.\
**Skills**: Python, pandas, NLTK, matplotlib, wordcloud, NLP, text preprocessing, tokenization, data visualization

### 🔹 [010 - Amazon Clone] Ongoing (https://github.com/shuwangs/portfolio/tree/main/010-full-stack-amazon-clone/amazon-clone)


### 🔹 [011 - Lisp Interpreter in C](https://github.com/shuwangs/portfolio/tree/main/011-lisp-interpreter-in-c)
