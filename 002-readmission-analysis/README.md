# 🏥 Hospital Readmissions Data Analysis

This project explores a real-world hospital dataset to uncover patterns in hospital stay durations, medical specialties, and readmission rates. It is part of my personal learning journey while transitioning into a Software/Data Engineering role, and demonstrates my skills in Python, Pandas, data analysis, and data visualization.

---

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset contains **25,000 hospital visit records** with the following key columns:
- `age`: Patient age group (e.g., `[70-80)`)
- `time_in_hospital`: Number of days the patient stayed
- `medical_specialty`: Department responsible for care
- `readmitted`: Whether the patient was readmitted soon after discharge
- `n_medications`, `n_lab_procedures`, etc.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand the distribution of hospital stay durations
- Compare average hospital stay by **medical specialty**
- Examine how **age** affects hospital time
- Explore relationship between **readmission** and length of stay

---

## 🔧 Tools Used

- **Python 3**
- **Pandas** for data processing
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** for exploratory analysis

---

## 📊 Key Findings

- Certain medical specialties are associated with longer hospital stays
- Older age groups tend to have slightly longer average hospital time
- Patients who were readmitted sometimes show different hospital stay patterns
